            <p><small>Because Snowplow delivers high-resolution, event data into our client's own data warehouses, our clients are free to pick whatever combination of analysis and business intelligence tools to analyse that data with.</small></p>

Looker takes a very innovative approach to business intelligence, that is especially well-suited to empowering individuals across an organisation to explore and drive insight from large quantities of event-level data.</small></p>

        <h3>Implementation partners</h3>
        <p>Our implementation partners work with business both to integrate Snowplow tracking (including developing client-specific event dictionaries) and drive insight from the Snowplow data. We are in talks with a range of different companies, of different sizes and specialisms, to become implementation partners, and look forward to announcing them in due course.</p>
