We, the data community, have only scratched the surface in terms of what is possible with all that data.</p>
            <p class="spacer-bottom-40">For companies engaging with users through digital platforms, this data is potentially invaluable. Used right, the  data can enable those companies to better understand and better serve those customers. That data can be used to ask and answer an impossibly large set of fascinating questions.</p>
            <p class="spacer-bottom-40">Used right, the insight gleaned is transformative: enabling companies to develop deep user-level understanding and use that to delight their customers, identify and execute on new opportunities, to grow and to flourish.</p>

            <p class="spacer-bottom-40">At Snowplow, we build technology to unlock the value of data. Part of that is ensuring that our users have unfettered ownership and access to their own data, in a structured, easy to use format, so that they can plugin as many different analysis tools as possible. The data space is full of companies building innovative tools. We want our users to be able to work with any of them: a decision to work with Snowplow should never be at the expense of the myriad other services out there.</p>
            <p class="spacer-bottom-40">The world of data opportunity is much too big for one vendor, or even a handful of big vendors.</p>
