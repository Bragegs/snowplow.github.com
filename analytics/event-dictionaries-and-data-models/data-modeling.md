# Data modeling

The data collection and enrichment process generates an event stream. It is possible to do analysis on this event stream, but it is common to join with other data sets (e.g. customer data, product data, marketing data or financial data) and aggregate event-levfel data into smaller data sets. These have the benefit of being easier to understand and faster to run analyses against. Also, if analysis is done against this data set, the same business logical will be used by all users of the data.
