# Basic concepts

## Who this section is for

It is possible to use Snowplow data to answer questions and generate insight without a deep knowledge of the basic concepts that underpin the Snowplow approach to event data collection, warehouse and analysis. If you are serious about using Snowplow in the most effective way, however, and are looking to perform more sophisticated analyses, or empower a broader range of business users to expore Snowplow data, we strongly recommend becoming familiar with these foundational concepts.

## What are the basic concepts?

Snowplow is built around the following core concepts:

1. [Events](events.html)
2. [Dictionaries and schemas](event-dictionaries-and-schemas.html)
3. [Contexts](contexts.html)
4. [Iglu](iglu.html)
5. [Stages in the Snowplow data pipeline](collection-enrichment-modelling-analysis.html)

Once you have understood the core concepts, it should be straightforward to understand:

1. [How event data is sent into Snowplow](sending-data-into-snowplow.html)
2. [What the data looks like once it is in Snowplow](#viewing-the-data-in-snowplow.html)

This then provides a solid foundation for understanding how to 

1. [Instrument Snowplow trackers](instrument-snowplow-trackers.html)
2. [Perform basic anayses on Snowplow data](perform-basic-analyses-on-snowplow-data.html)
3. [Model Snowplow data: aggregate event level data to create useful intermediary tables to enable faster, more convenient analysis](model-snowplow-data.html)
