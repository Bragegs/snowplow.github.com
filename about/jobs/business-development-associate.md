# Business Development Associate (London, UK or NYC, USA)

Snowplow is a best in class analytics platform, changing the way that people do digital analytics. We have commercial relationships with more than 100 data-sophisticated companies around the world (including UK, USA, Germany, Netherlands, France, Australia, Israel and Dubai), built up over a very short period of time.

That growth has been driven by the strength of our platform: to date nearly all our effort, as a company, has been product, engineering and analytics focused. Now we have reached a stage in the evolution of the company where we're looking to invest heavily in growing. We're looking for Business Development Associate to drive that growth.

This role is a chance to take what we've built so far, and scale it across 100s, 1000s and tens of thousands more customers and partners. We have some ideas how we should do that - we're looking for someone who'll come along with their own ideas, and then work with us to execute on them

If you are:

* **Passionate** about data and the way companies (our clients) can leverage data and technology to build competitive advantage
* **Curious** - interested to understand problems from our users perspective
* Strategic - able to take what you learn with individual customers and partners, learn from it, and apply that to our overall sales, partnerships and marketing efforts to drive growth
* **Entrepeneurial** - you want to make stuff happen
* **Personable** - work with people in different roles, companies and timezones to make stuf happen

we want to work with you. This is an incredible opportunity for the right candidate to help us grow Snowplow and change the way that digital and event analytics is done, all over the world.
