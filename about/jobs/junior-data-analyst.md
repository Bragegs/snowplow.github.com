<h1>Junior Data Analyst <small>London, UK</small></h1>

At Snowplow, we are focused on re-inventing the way that companies do digital analytics.

Part of achieving this goal is through building technology. A big part of it, however, is working with our users to help them understand and adopt new approaches. To do that we are building out a data team and we are looking for a junior analyst to join it.

## What you would do

As a rapidly growing startup with a small team, the junior analyst would work across a wide range of different areas:

1. **Client projects**. Helping our users take their Snowplow data and use it to build insights and/or design data driven products
2. **Client support**. Work with our clients on an ad hoc basis to answer their questions
3. **Client onboarding and training**. Run workshops and train our clients in our methodology and approach, including how to deploy the different tools in the Snowplow arsenal
4. **Documentation, blogging and discourse**. Publish recipes and guides to help the broader Snowplow community
5. **Analytics partner integrations**. Snowplow delivers data. To get value from Snowplow, our users need to plug in additional products and services to do useful things with that data. Figuring out which tools in the data system add most value for our users and working with those companies to make an integration as easy as possible is enormously helpful for our users

## What we are looking for

We're looking for a candidate who:

* Loves data and working with data
* Is intellectual curious
* Is excited to try new things including tools and technologies  
* Likes to learn by doing, failing and trying again
* Likes being challenged
* Is self-motivated: happy to figure stuff out with minimal direction
* Is a clear thinker who is comfortable explaining her / his thinking, discussing and challenging different approaches and working collaboratively and creatively to identify new approaches
* Is hands on - like to deliver: commit code, draw concrete insights

Technically we want to see a high level of proficiency in performing data analysis in spreadsheets and other tools. A basic understanding of statistics and familiarity with SQL, R and Python and any kind of programmatic analysis is valuable but not necessary.

## What you will get if you join our team

* A complete all round on-the-job training in digital analytics
* An opportunity to work with some of the most data-sophisticated companies around the world
* A seat at the cutting edge of how digital analytics is changing
* An opportunity to shape how the industry is changing


## When you will start

We are looking for a candidate to start with an internship over the summer. If that goes well we have the possibility of offering a full time position.

We are flexible on start times.
