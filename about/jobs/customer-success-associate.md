# Customer Success Associate (London, UK or NYC, USA)

Snowplow customers use our platform to solve an enormous range of different types of problems. Because we deliver a detailed, structured record of potentially everything that has occurred in their business, there is an enormous amount that our users can do with the data. 

Snowplow enables companies to do digital analtyics in a totally new way. The Snowplow pipeline evolves with our users' businesses. Gone are the days of 3-9 month instrumentation products - our users can slowly roll out tracking of new events and entities over time, and develop their data models as they develop more sophisticated approaches crunching their data. 

Both of the above mean that new Snowplow users typically go through a journey when they start with Snowplow, where they learn how to change their approach to data capture, processing and analysis to benefit from the new possibilities that Snowplow enables. 

The Customer Success Associate would work with our users, particular our new users, to help them through that journey, so that they become Snowplow power users within a short time, and start enabling change and better results within their respective businesses fast. We're looking for people who are:

* **Curious**. Interested in understanding the problem that our client's are trying to solve, from a commercial, analytic, technological and people point of view
* **Creative**. People who are good at solving problems with data are creative - solving problems is more about asking the right question, or recomposing a problem in a new light, than it is about knowing a long list of analytics approaches
* **Personable**. You would be working with a wide range of people in different roles, companies and timezones
* **Empowering others**. The point of your role is to empower our users to solve their problems today, and leave them better equipped to solve their problems tomorrow, than to solve their problems for them. 
* **Organised**. You will be working with a large number of companies and problems in parallel

If you want to work with some of the smartest people in digital analtyics to help them do what they do better, we want to hear from you. Send your CV to recruitment@snowplowanalytics.com.

<strong>We do not welcome calls from recruitment consultants.</strong>
