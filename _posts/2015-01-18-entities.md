At Snowplow we spend a lot of time thinking about how to model events. As businesses re-orient themselves around event streams under the [Unified Log model] [kreps], it becomes ever more important to properly model those event streams. After all: "garbage in" means "garbage out": deriving business value from events is hugely dependent on modeling those events correctly in the first place.

Our focus at Snowplow has been on defining a **semantic model** for events: one that is built around the intrinsic properties found across all events. A semantic model helps to prevent business and technology assumptions from leaking into the event stream. This works to guard against outdated assumptions becoming "fossilized" in the event stream, and helps to make those streams significantly less brittle - and easier to evolve - over time.

We proposed an initial model for Snowplow events in our August 2013 blog post, [Towards universal event analytics - building an event grammar] [event-grammar]. We have since discussed this approach with many interested parties, and have been pleased to follow other explorations of the topic, for example CARMEN'S BLOG POST SERIES. I've also made heavy use of this proposed event grammar in my in-progress book, [Unified Log Processing] [dean]. The semantic approach seems to have resonated widely.

However, our thinking has evolved from our original event grammar proposal in one important aspect. During the 18 months elapsed since that blog post, we have been exposed to many more event streams defined by many more customers, and we have also had the chance to experiment with aspects of the event grammar through our unstructured events, our custom contexts and more generally with our new [Iglu] [iglu] project. What we have learnt from all this can be summed up quite simply:

> An event is anything that we can observe occurring at a particular point in time. Each event is recorded with the set of involved entities as they stood at that point in time



 - all the work and this blog post looks at this tweaked app in some detail.

  think carefully about how to model the events in our streams. After all, Garbage In, Garbage Out: itâ€™s 

Writing the early chapters Unified Log Processing book, I've realized that there are some 

An entity

We use the word entity because the word object is too loaded - it has too many connotations from OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and it is confusing in a grammatical context too: it's much clearer to say that the event's subject and its direct object are both entities, than it is to say that the event's subject and its direct object are objects.
