Earlier this I was very fortunate to speak at the [DA Hub Europe](https://www.digitalanalyticshub.com/dahub16-europe/eu-homepage).

For those who haven't been lucky enough to attend this event, it is a brilliant opportunity to discuss, debate with and learn from some of the smartest people in Digital Analytics in Europe.

I used the talk as an opportunity to share some of our broader thinking at Snowplow with what has gone wrong with digital analytics, and how we're trying to fix it, by taking a fresh approach.

It was great discussing our approach with the attendees at the event. I'd love to share this with the wider Snowplow and Digital Analytics community, and build on that conversation.
