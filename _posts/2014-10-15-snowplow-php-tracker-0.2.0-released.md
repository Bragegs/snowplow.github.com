We are pleased to announce the release of the second version of the [Snowplow PHP Tracker] [repo]. The tracker now supports a variety of synchronous, asynchronous and out-of-band event emitters for GET and POST Requests.

This introductory post will cover the following topics:

1. [New emitters explained](/blog/2014/10/15/snowplow-php-tracker-0.2.0-released/#emitters)
2. [Debug mode added](/blog/2014/10/15/snowplow-php-tracker-0.2.0-released/#debug)
3. [Upgrading](/blog/2014/10/15/snowplow-php-tracker-0.2.0-released/#upgrading)
4. [Getting help](/blog/2014/10/15/snowplow-php-tracker-0.2.0-released/#help)

We now have four different emitters available for use with the PHP Tracker, all of which fully support Snowplow's collectors via `GET` and `POST`:

1. The `Sync` emitter or synchronous emitter is a carry-over from version 0.1.0 and has not changed
2. The `Socket` emitter is a new collector with the ability to write Requests directly to an HTTP socket; this has delivered a drastic speed improvement over `Sync`.  However it is still synchronous in its operation
3. The `Curl` emitter provides a 'nearly' asynchronous Request emitter, in that we can send multiple requests simultaneously! This emitter shines in `GET` operation as by nature we can only include one event per `GET` request; much faster operation than socket
4. The `File` emitter delivers a non-blocking out-of-band emitter. This works by spawning a background worker process which consumes log files filled with events which are generated by the Tracker. It uses the same framework as the `Curl` Emitter but it does not halt the main script from executing and we can have as our host machine allows.

More information for the PHP Trackers Emitters can be found in the [wiki][technical-documentation].

<h2><a name="debug">2. Debug mode added</a></h2>
</div>

The emitters included with the PHP Tracker now come with debug mode. This mode sets up local logging of any errors that the emitters might run into, such as an invalid host or the inability to establish a socket connection to the collector.

On any failures it will record the error along with the payload that was meant to be sent. To enable debug mode, all you need to do is to append a `true` boolean to the end of the emitter constructor like so:

{% highlight php %}
$emitter = new Emitter("sync", array(
                "uri" => "d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net",
                "type" => "POST",
                "protocol" => NULL,
                "buffer" => NULL
            ),
            true # Just append a boolean here and debug mode will begin collecting information!
        );
{% endhighlight %}

The `File` emitter does not yet have debugging included, however we are essentially repurposing the `Curl` emitter: if one works the other should have no issues!

All debug files will be logged at this address: `directory_root\debug\sync-events-random_number.log`.

For more information on debugging please consult the [wiki][technical-documentation].

The Snowplow PHP Tracker is published to [Packagist] [packagist], the central repository for Composer PHP packages. To add the latest version to your project, add it as a requirement in your `composer.json` file:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "require": {
        "snowplow/snowplow-tracker": "0.2.0"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then simply run `composer update` from the root of your project to install it.
