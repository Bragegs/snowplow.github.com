# Snowplow is an event analytics platform

Snowplow enables you to:

1. Record events from your website, mobile app, server side system, third party systems and any type of connected device, so that you have a record of *what happened, when, and to whom*
2. Processes that data, including validating, enriching and modeling it
3. Loads the processed data into a datawarehouse to power analysis
4. Makes that data available to real-time data processing applications, to action that data in real-time
