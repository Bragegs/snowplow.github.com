<h1>Case study: data-driven product development and neuroscience at Peak</h1>

<h2>Introducing Peak</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Cognitive training platform with a difference: games built by neuroscientists to exercise mental skills such as memory, mental agility, problem solving, language and more</li>
	<li>Collaborate with neuroscience researchers & psychologists at Yale, Cambridge and other universities to build advanced training programs</li>
	<li>Turns your smartphone into a system for brain measurement, brain tracking and brain training</li>
	<li>More than 8 million users since late 2014 launch. Apple’s “Best App of 2014” and Google Play’s “Best of 2015”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Snowplow @ Peak</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Peak has been using Snowplow since July 2015</li>
	<li>Data is loaded into Amazon Redshift where it is modelled</li>
	<li>The data is socialised throughout the business via dashboards in <a href="https://modeanalytics.com/">Mode Analytics</a>. The data team build predictive models on the data using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a></li>
	<li>All data loading, storage and modelling is compliant with EU regulations on data security and data privacy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data driven neuroscience</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Data is at the heart of the science behind Peak</li>
	<li>Every game is personalised to build players’ skills as efficiently as possible</li>
	<li>Sophisticated normalisation of scores helps compare your progress to your friends</li>
	<li>Game developers have instant access to game data via Snowplow to make sure the games are of the highest quality</li>
	<li>Scientific analysis of game scores</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data driven product development</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Data analytics plays an integral role in the product development process at Peak</li>
	<li>Every new feature launched by the Peak is tested against a subset of the Peak user base as an A/B test</li>
	<li>Success criteria (and associated metrics) are defined ahead of the feature test</li>
	<li>If successful, the feature is rolled out across the rest of the user base. If not, it is rolled back</li>
	<li>The Peak team pushes new releases every 2 weeks. Typically 10 features are in test at any one time</li>
	<li>Snowplow makes it easy for the Peak to track each new test easily, and then assess the impact of the new feature very flexibly.</li>
</ul>
