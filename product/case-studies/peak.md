		<p>Peak is a cognitive training platform with a difference: mobile games that are built by neuroscientists to exercise mental skills such as memory, mental agility, problem solving, language and more. It has more than 8 million users since launch in late 2014, and has been awarded Apple's "Best App of 2014" and Google Play's "Best of 2015".</p>
		<p>Peak has been using Snowplow since July 2015. Snowplow is an integral part of the product development and neuroscience development processeses at Peak.</p>

				<h2>Data driven neuroscience</h2>
				<p><q>Our games are inspired by neuroscientific research. With our academic partners we are unlocking a new chapter in cognitive research by studying game scores and cognitive learning for millions of users. Snowplow is an integral part of that.</q></p>

				<ul>
					<li>Data is at the heart of the science behind Peak</li>
					<li>Every game is personalised to build players’ skills as efficiently as possible</li>
					<li>Sophisticated normalisation of scores helps compare each individual's progress to his and her friends</li>
					<li>Game developers have instant access to game data via Snowplow to make sure the games are of the highest quality</li>
					<li>The Peak team use scientific analysis of game scores to understand the game impact on cognitive development</li>

				<h2>Data driven product development</h2>
				<p><q>We make no changes to the app without A/B testing it first. Before we launch a feature we define a methodology for defining the success and failure of that feature. Everything happens with data… Snowplow’s event based approach makes it very easy to create new events, new schemas, on the fly.</q></p>

			<div class="card c1 left" style="clear: left">
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Data analytics plays an integral role in the product development process at Peak</li>
						<li>Every new feature launched by the Peak is tested against a subset of the Peak user base as an A/B test</li>
						<li>Success criteria (and associated metrics) are defined ahead of the feature test</li>
						<li>If successful, the feature is rolled out across the rest of the user base. If not, it is rolled back</li>
						<li>The Peak team pushes new releases every 2 weeks. Typically 10 features are in test at any one time</li>
						<li>Snowplow makes it easy for the Peak to track each new test easily, and then assess the impact of the new feature very flexibly.</li>
