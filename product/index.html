    <h1 style="text-align:center">The event data pipeline.</h1>
    <p>There are two versions of the Snowplow event data pipeline:</p>

    <div class="box">
      <div class="box-header">2 pipelines</div>
      <div class="box-text half">
        <p><strong>Batch pipeline</strong></p>
        <p>Load your event-level data into your data warehouse to perform advanced analytics.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box-text half">
        <p><strong>Real-time pipeline</strong></p>
        <p>Load your event-level data into your data warehouse, and make that same data available to data-driven applications and dashboards in real-time.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Both pipelines have the same high-level architecture:</p>

    <h3>Flexible enrichment process.</h3>
    <p>Snowplow enriches data after it has been collected, but before it’s stored in Amazon S3 or Redshift. This is the best place to join in sensitive data, external data sources, or data that varies in time. We support these enrichments:</p>
    <p><ul>
    	<li>GeoIP lookup</li>
      <li>Weather lookup</li>
      <li>SQL and RESTful API lookup</li>
      <li>Useragent and referer parsing</li>
    	<li>Campaign and marketing data parsing</li>
      <li>Currency conversions</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>Track events from <em>anywhere</em></h3>
    <p>Track events from your own applications using our extensive library of trackers...</p>
    <p><img src="img/tracker-logos.png"></p>
    <p>...track events from third party applictions via our webhook integrations.</p>

    <h3>Built to scale.</h3>

    <h3>Load your data where you need it</h3>
    <p>Where your data lives has a big impact on what you can do with it. Snowplow supports loading your data into the following data stores out-of-the-box:</p>

    <h3>Act on the data. Fast.</h3>
    <p>The real-time pipeline processes events in mere seconds. This opens up a world of possibilities.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="container narrow">
    <h3>Built for trust.</h3>
    <p>Snowplow is the opposite of a black box. Each step in the pipeline is 100% auditable. We store the data that passed validation. And the data that didn't. The bad data is loaded into Kibana, where it can be queried to diagnose and resolve data collection issues.</p>

    <h3>Your data. Your pipeline.</h3>
    <p>We don’t believe in owning other people’s data. The data never lives on our servers.</p>

    <h3>Stay current</h3>
    <p>The Snowplow event data pipeline is architected so that it can evolve with you and your business, as:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>The events you track change (because your business is always changing)</li>
      <li>The questions you ask of your data become more sophisticated</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h3>It’s all open source.</h3>
    <p>Snowplow is 100% open source. Thousands of organisations, and many of them have contributed.</p>
