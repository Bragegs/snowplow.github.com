      <h3>What is included with the open source version?</h3>

      <div class="row">
        <p>We love open source. Snowplow was built on top of incredible open source projects and we believe people should be able to run the Snowplow pipeline themselves.
        The full codebase is available on <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow">GitHub</a>. Feel free to contribute as well.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Do I need a separate AWS account?</h3>

      <div class="row">
        <p>Yes. We believe that companies should own their own data. With the open source, we don't have access to the data at all. If you use the managed service but decide to leave, you still have all your data in your own data warehouse.</p>
