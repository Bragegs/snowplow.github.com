      <h3>Batch vs real-time</h3>

      <div class="row"><!-- added to have the correct first-child behaviour -->
        <p>With the Snowplow batch pipeline, you can track all events from your website, mobile app, server side systems, third party systems and any type of connected device, so that you have a record of what happened, when, and to whom. The Snowplow pipeline then processes these eventsand loads them into your <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/redshift">Amazon Redshift</a> data warewarehouse to you can join them with other data sets and perform sophisticated analysis on that data.</p>
        <p>The real-time pipeline supports the regular loading of events into <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/redshift">Redshift</a>, as well as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Publishing your event data into an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Amazon Kinesis</a> stream, for real-time processing of the data in real-time applications (e.g. personalization, marketing automation)</li>
          <li>Delivering real-time reports and dashboards e.g. by loading your data into <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both the <a href="/get-started/batch/">Managed Service Batch</a> and <a href="/get-started/real-time/">Managed Service Real Time</a> are available for a 30 day trial.</p>
      </div>


      <h3>Managed Service vs open source</h3>

      <div class="row">
        <p>The core Snowplow data pipeline is open source. You are free to set it up and run it yourself on your own AWS account.</p>
        <p>Setting up, managing, monitoring, repairing and upgrading the open source platform (either batch or real-time) requires significant devops expertise. We offer a Managed Service for companies that do not have those expertise, or have them but wish to deploy them to doing more with the data.</p>
        <p>The Snowplow team can setup, manage, montitor and upgrade your Snowplow data pipeline as part of the Managed Service. We have a significant amount of propriatary technology that we use to programmatically setup, instrument, upgrade, closely monitor and repair client data pipelines, as a service.</p>
        <p>We setup and run pipelines for our Managed Service users on their own AWS accounts. This means that they still own all their own data. It also means they are free to leave our service if they wish, without losing access to their data. This gives our users the best of both worlds: the convenience of a service, with the assurance that they own all their onw data.</p>
      <p>You can trial the <a href="batch">managed service – batch </a> free for one month. The real-time pipeline is available as a private beta on our <a href="real-time">managed service</a>.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>What is included with the open source version?</h3>

      <div class="row">
        <p>We love open source. Snowplow was built on top of incredible open source projects and we believe people should be able to take our code and fork or run the Snowplow pipeline themselves. The full codebase is available on <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow">GitHub</a>. We also provide limited support to our open source users on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/snowplow-user">user group</a>.</p>
        <p>The managed service gives users the option to run Snowplow as a service: Have rich event-level data delivered into your own data warehouse without the overhead associated with running a data pipeline yourself.</p>
