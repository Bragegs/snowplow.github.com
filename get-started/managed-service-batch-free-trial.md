		<h2>Register for a free 30-day trial of the managed service batch.</h2>

		<p>The trial allows you to explore what becomes possible when you have direct access to your granular, event-level data. Here is how it works:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>We provide you with a tag to integrate the Javascript tracker (or another tracker of your choice) in your website, mobile app or application</li>
			<li>You integrate the appropriate Snowplow tracker</li>
			<li>We provide you with credentials so you can access your data in our own Amazon Redshift cluster</li>
			<li>You plug in the analysis tools of your choice so you can see what is possible with your data</li>
			<li>We can also, under certain circumstances, offer you a <a href="http://looker.com">Looker</a> trial on top of your Snowplow data, so you can see how the combination of Snowplow and Looker gives business users unprecedented flexibility to explore and mine your event-level data.</li>
			<li>If after your trial you decide to sign up to the Managed Service, we will migrate your data over for you for no additional cost.</li>
		</ul>
