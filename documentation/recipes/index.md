## Analytics with Snowplow data

Snowplow gives companies access to their event-level data. This makes it possible to perform a whole range of sophisticated analysis that are otherwise not possible. The data modeling step lowers the barrier to entry, by codifying the underlying aggregation and business logic, so analysts can focus on performing a wide variety of analyses using Snowplow data. This section contains a whole range of recipes that highlight what is possible with event-level data:

- [Customer analytics][customer-analytics]: Understand customers and users
- [Catalog analytics][catalog-analytics]: Understand how content and product drives behavior and value
- [Platform analytics][platform-analytics]: Understand how updates change user behavior and drive value
